## BgCrop
Automatic image background cropping tool.

NOTE: This tool was designed to remove white background only.

This was developed for my father-in-law, who scans alot of old family photos, and was tired of having to crop
each and every photo.

# How to use:
1. In the BgCrop folder, create the folders "Photos" and "Cropped".
2. place all the photos you want to crop in the "BgCrop\Photos" folder.
3. double-click BgCrop.py
4. Now all of your photos are cropped and placed in the "BgCrop\Cropped\" folder.

# Dependencies:
1. Pillow (PIL)
2. RegEx (re)
