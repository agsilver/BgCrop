## BgCrop
Automatic image background cropping tool.

NOTE: This tool was designed to remove white background only.

This was developed for my father-in-law, who scans alot of old family photos, and was tired of having to crop
each and every photo.

# How to use:
1. place all the photos you want to crop in the "BgCrop\Photos" folder. 
2. double-click BgCrop.py
3. Now all of your photos are cropped and placed in the "BgCrop\Cropped\" folder.

# Dependencies:
1. Pillow (PIL)
2. RegEx (re)
